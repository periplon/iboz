## 1. Document Control
- **Version:** 1.0
- **Date:** 2025-09-21
- **Authors:** Product Management Team
- **Approvers:** CTO, Head of Customer Operations

## 2. Executive Summary
The Inbox Zero Automation Platform enables knowledge workers to sustain an empty inbox by automatically classifying incoming emails, taking pre-defined actions, and facilitating focused work sessions. The system combines deterministic rules with optional large language model (LLM) services from multiple vendors to identify email intent, urgency, and required workflows while safeguarding privacy and compliance requirements.

## 3. Objectives & Goals
1. Reduce manual email triage time by 70% within three months of deployment.
2. Achieve and maintain <10 emails in the inbox for 85% of active users.
3. Increase completion rate of high-priority actions identified from emails by 40%.
4. Provide explainable classification results with user override capability to reach a 95% user satisfaction score for accuracy.

## 4. Scope
- **In Scope:**
  - Email ingestion from major providers (Google Workspace, Microsoft 365, IMAP).
  - Automatic classification of emails into actionable categories (e.g., Urgent Action, Delegated, FYI, Spam, Newsletter, Follow-Up, Waiting).
  - Deterministic rule engine (filters, regex, sender lists) and pluggable LLM-based classification.
  - Automated actions (auto-respond, snooze, delegate, create tasks, archive) based on classification and user-configurable workflows.
  - Work focus features (focus timer, batching, summaries, digests) tied to classified workstreams.
  - User feedback loops to refine both deterministic and model-based classifiers.
  - Security, audit logging, and compliance to enterprise standards (SOC 2, GDPR).
- **Out of Scope:**
  - Building an email client UI from scratch; assume integration via browser extension or existing client add-ins.
  - Voice interface for email triage.
  - SMS/Chat ingestion (roadmap consideration).

## 5. Stakeholders
- **Primary Users:** Knowledge workers, customer support leads, sales teams.
- **Secondary Users:** Team managers, IT administrators.
- **Internal Stakeholders:** Product, Engineering, Data Science, Security, Compliance, Support, Marketing.

## 6. User Personas & Needs
1. **Busy Executive (Alex):** Receives 300+ emails daily, needs urgent items surfaced and delegated work tracked.
2. **Customer Support Lead (Jordan):** Manages shared mailbox, needs SLA adherence alerts and automated replies.
3. **Sales Representative (Taylor):** Requires quick access to leads, follow-up reminders, and CRM synchronization.
4. **Operations Analyst (Casey):** Needs accurate classification for reporting, compliance logging, and integration with ticketing systems.

## 7. User Journeys
1. Alex connects their email account, reviews suggested classification rules, and schedules focus blocks for "Urgent Action" emails. The system auto-delegates tasks to direct reports and archives informational messages.
2. Jordan configures deterministic filters for known customer issues and enables an LLM to suggest responses for uncommon inquiries. SLA breaches trigger automatic escalation actions.
3. Taylor triages emails via summaries generated every hour, converts qualified leads into CRM opportunities, and snoozes newsletters to a weekly digest.

## 8. Functional Requirements
### 8.1 Email Ingestion & Connectivity
- Support OAuth-based authentication for Google Workspace and Microsoft 365.
- Provide secure credential storage and token refresh management.
- Synchronize emails (read/unread, flags, folders) bidirectionally at configurable intervals.

### 8.2 Classification Engine
- Allow creation of deterministic rules using sender, recipient, keywords, time of day, and attachments.
- Offer library of pre-built rule templates for common use cases (e.g., receipts, meeting invites).
- Integrate with multiple LLM vendors (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Azure) via abstraction layer.
- Support fallback logic between deterministic rules and LLM outputs, including confidence thresholds.
- Generate explanations for each classification with source attribution.
- Log all classification decisions for auditing and user review.

### 8.3 Automatic Actions
- Configure action workflows per category (e.g., auto-respond with template, create task in Asana, escalate to Slack channel).
- Support sequential and conditional actions (IF urgent AND sender=VIP THEN notify via mobile push).
- Provide safe-guard approvals for destructive actions (e.g., deletion) with user confirmation.
- Allow scheduling of actions (e.g., send reply during business hours).
- Track completion state and link to external tools (task managers, CRM, ticketing).

### 8.4 Work Focus Mode
- Present daily focus plan summarizing actionable categories and estimated effort.
- Enable batching of similar emails into focus sessions with timers and distraction blocking (silence non-urgent notifications).
- Provide quick context (summaries, key points, attachments) to minimize context switching.
- Offer progress tracking dashboard (emails cleared, tasks created, outstanding follow-ups).

### 8.5 User Feedback & Training
- Allow users to reclassify emails and submit feedback; system updates rules or model prompts accordingly.
- Capture implicit signals (time to respond, actions taken) to refine automation suggestions.
- Provide A/B testing framework for new classification strategies.

### 8.6 Administration & Governance
- Role-based access control for users, managers, and admins.
- Support multi-tenant configuration for enterprise customers.
- Offer audit logs, exportable reports, and compliance policy enforcement (data residency, retention).
- Provide vendor management controls: enable/disable specific LLM providers per tenant.

## 9. Non-Functional Requirements
- **Performance:** Process new emails within 30 seconds of receipt; classification accuracy target ≥90% for critical categories.
- **Scalability:** Support 50,000 active users with peak loads of 10 emails/second per tenant.
- **Security:** End-to-end encryption in transit and at rest, minimal data retention for LLM processing, configurable redaction.
- **Reliability:** 99.9% uptime SLA with automatic failover across regions.
- **Privacy:** PII masking before sending content to third-party LLMs; configurable data-sharing policies.
- **Compliance:** Align with SOC 2 Type II, ISO 27001, GDPR, CCPA. Maintain vendor risk assessments.
- **Usability:** Onboarding completed in <15 minutes with guided setup wizards.

## 10. Data & Integrations
- **Data Sources:** Email content, headers, calendar availability, CRM records, task managers.
- **Storage:** Encrypted metadata store (PostgreSQL), vector store for embeddings, secure file storage for attachments.
- **Integrations:** Slack, Teams, Asana, Jira, Salesforce, ServiceNow, Zapier.
- **APIs:** REST/GraphQL for actions, Webhooks for notifications, SDKs for partner extensions.

## 11. LLM Strategy
- Provide vendor-agnostic interface supporting OpenAI, Anthropic, Google PaLM/Gemini, Azure OpenAI.
- Maintain prompt templates for classification, summarization, action recommendations, and response drafting.
- Implement cost monitoring, usage quotas, and fallback to deterministic logic on vendor outages.
- Offer on-premise or customer-managed model deployment option for regulated industries.
- Ensure human-in-the-loop review for high-risk actions, with configurable confidence thresholds.

## 12. Reporting & Analytics
- Dashboard for inbox health (average inbox size, time-to-zero, automation success rate).
- Analytics on classification accuracy, action usage, LLM vendor performance, and user feedback trends.
- Exportable reports (CSV, BI connectors) for compliance and operations reviews.

## 13. Success Metrics & KPIs
- Inbox Zero attainment rate per user/segment.
- Time saved (hours/week) vs baseline manual triage.
- Automation adoption (percentage of emails auto-classified and actioned without manual intervention).
- User satisfaction (NPS, CSAT) per persona.
- Reduction in SLA breaches for operational teams.

## 14. Risks & Mitigations
- **LLM hallucination or misclassification** → implement guardrails, confidence thresholds, human review.
- **Data privacy concerns** → support on-device processing, redaction, vendor selection controls.
- **User trust and adoption** → provide transparent explanations and easy override of automation.
- **Vendor lock-in** → maintain modular architecture for classifiers and actions.
- **Regulatory changes** → maintain compliance monitoring and update policies promptly.

## 15. Implementation Roadmap (High-Level)
1. **MVP (Quarter 1):** Email connectivity, deterministic rules, manual trigger for actions, focus dashboard.
2. **Phase 2 (Quarter 2):** LLM integration with explainability, automated workflows, feedback loop.
3. **Phase 3 (Quarter 3):** Advanced analytics, multi-tenant governance, expanded integrations.
4. **Phase 4 (Quarter 4):** On-prem LLM support, predictive work scheduling, AI copilots for drafting responses.

## 16. Open Questions
- What regions require data residency controls at launch?
- Which LLM vendors meet enterprise compliance for initial rollout?
- How will pricing differentiate between deterministic-only vs LLM-augmented tiers?
- What SLA commitments are required for critical integrations (CRM, task managers)?
