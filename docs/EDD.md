## Codex Framework Overview
This EDD follows the CODEx (Context, Outcomes, Design, Experiments, eXecution) framework to convert the strategic vision of the Inbox Zero Automation Platform into a detailed, testable experience plan.

---

## 1. Context & Customer Problem (C)
### 1.1 Business Context
- Knowledge workers are overwhelmed by high-volume email streams that mix urgent requests, reference material, and noise.
- Organizations seek automation that respects compliance obligations (SOC 2, GDPR) while integrating with existing tools (CRM, task managers, chat).
- Leadership requires demonstrable ROI within 3 months of rollout to justify enterprise adoption.

### 1.2 User & Persona Insights
| Persona | Pain Points | Desired Outcomes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Busy Executive (Alex) | Context switching, missed escalations, manual delegation | Immediate surfacing of urgent tasks, automated routing |
| Customer Support Lead (Jordan) | SLA adherence risk, repetitive triage, shared mailbox chaos | Reliable auto-responses, escalation triggers, reporting |
| Sales Representative (Taylor) | Follow-up fatigue, CRM friction, newsletter overload | Lead prioritization, one-click CRM sync, digest summaries |
| Operations Analyst (Casey) | Data accuracy, compliance logging, analytics | Explainable classifications, audit-ready exports |

### 1.3 Problem Statement
"How might we automate high-volume inbox management so that 85% of users consistently maintain <10 emails, without sacrificing compliance or user trust?"

### 1.4 Success Signals
- 70% reduction in manual triage time measured by time-on-task studies.
- 95% perceived accuracy of automated classifications collected via in-app feedback.
- 40% lift in completion of urgent items compared to pre-implementation baseline.

## 2. Outcomes & Experience Goals (O)
### 2.1 North Star Experience
Deliver a daily command center where users can immediately understand what requires action, trust automated workflows, and collaborate seamlessly across teams.

### 2.2 Experience Principles
1. **Transparent Automation** – Always expose why an email was classified or actioned, with user override controls.
2. **Focused Momentum** – Guide users into time-boxed work modes with batched tasks and distraction controls.
3. **Progress Feedback** – Reinforce progress towards Inbox Zero with real-time dashboards and celebratory milestones.
4. **Compliance by Design** – Surface data handling decisions and approvals inline with workflows.

### 2.3 Metrics-to-Motion Mapping
| Metric | Experience Lever | Instrumentation |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Inbox Zero attainment rate | Focus Mode entry, Digest scheduling | Session tracking, digest opt-in logs |
| Time saved per user/week | Automation run rate, manual overrides | Workflow execution logs, reclassification events |
| Automation adoption | Rule template usage, LLM response acceptance | Template library analytics, LLM confidence telemetry |
| User trust score | Explanation views, feedback submission | Tooltip open rates, survey results |

---

## 3. Design & Interaction Blueprint (D)
### 3.1 Core Journeys
1. **First-Run Setup**
   - Guided OAuth authentication for Google/Microsoft accounts.
   - Rule template suggestions (receipts, calendar invites, VIP senders).
   - Optional LLM toggle with compliance notice and redaction options.
2. **Daily Triage Dashboard**
   - Action queue segmented by urgency (Urgent, Today, Later, Delegated, Waiting).
   - Inline explanations with link to audit log entry.
   - Quick actions: auto-reply, create task (Asana, Jira), delegate, snooze.
3. **Focus Mode Session**
   - Batching similar emails, showing estimated effort, countdown timer.
   - Distraction mute toggles (pause notifications, block non-urgent emails).
   - Completion summary with recommended follow-up actions.
4. **Admin Governance Console**
   - Tenant-wide LLM vendor settings and quotas.
   - Audit log exports and compliance policy enforcement.
   - User-level automation adoption reports.

### 3.2 Information Architecture
- **Navigation**: Dashboard, Focus Mode, Automations, Analytics, Admin (for authorized roles).
- **Automation Builder**: Three-pane layout (Trigger, Conditions, Actions) with preview of downstream tools, implemented as reusable React components styled with Tailwind design tokens.
- **Insights Drawer**: Collapsible panel showing classification rationale, historical actions, related tasks.

### 3.3 UX Artifacts & Deliverables
| Artifact | Purpose | Owner | Due |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Low-fidelity wireframes (setup, dashboard, focus) | Align stakeholders on flow | Product Design | Week 1 |
| Interactive prototype (Figma) | Usability testing & stakeholder review | Product Design | Week 3 |
| Content style guide for explanations | Ensure consistent messaging | UX Writing | Week 2 |
| Automation builder React/Tailwind component specs | Handoff to engineering | Design Systems | Week 4 |

### 3.4 Technical Architecture & Stack Alignment
- **Back-End Services (Go)**: Build API and automation services with Go, leveraging goroutines for concurrent classification, rule execution, and integrations. Adopt a hexagonal architecture with domain packages for email ingestion, routing, and audit logging, and expose REST + WebSocket endpoints through an HTTP framework such as Echo or Fiber.
- **Embedded Front-End (React + Tailwind)**: Create a single-page application in React with Tailwind CSS utility styling. Compile static assets via Vite, then embed them into the Go binary using `//go:embed` so the application can be deployed as a self-contained executable with CDN fallbacks disabled by default for compliance.
- **Event & Queue Processing**: Utilize Go workers backed by a message broker (e.g., NATS or AWS SQS) to manage automation jobs, LLM requests, and SLA escalation workflows. Ensure idempotent handlers and retries with exponential backoff.
- **Observability & Telemetry**: Instrument Go services with OpenTelemetry exporters and expose Prometheus metrics for automation throughput, queue depth, and response times. Forward structured logs to the analytics pipeline for alignment with experiment KPIs.
- **Security Considerations**: Implement OAuth token storage using Go's `crypto` libraries and KMS integrations, enforce rate limiting via middleware, and bundle the React assets with Subresource Integrity hashes for tamper detection.

### 3.5 Accessibility & Localization
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance with focus states, keyboard navigation, and color contrast.
- Localization-ready UI copy with placeholders for right-to-left languages.
- Screen reader descriptions for automation steps and classification reasons.

4. **Sprint 3 (Week 6-7)** – Harden governance console, complete accessibility pass, finalize Tailwind design tokens, prepare beta launch kit.
5. **Sprint 4 (Week 8)** – Pilot with 3 tenants, monitor KPIs, iterate on feedback for GA readiness.

### 5.3 Dependencies & Risks
- **LLM Vendor Readiness**: Contracts and data processing agreements must be in place before enabling LLM features.
- **Security Reviews**: Automation builder requires threat modeling for destructive actions (delete, auto-respond) and verification that embedded React assets remain hash-validated across deployments.
- **Change Management**: Users transitioning from manual triage need onboarding content and enablement sessions.
- **Integration Complexity**: CRM and task manager APIs vary; requires prioritized integration list to avoid scope creep and Go SDK feasibility assessments.

### 5.4 Actionable Next Steps
1. Schedule discovery interviews with at least two representatives per persona within the next 10 business days.
2. Deliver low-fidelity wireframes for dashboard and focus mode to engineering for feasibility review by end of Week 1.
3. Define analytics event contracts with Data Engineering before Sprint 2 kickoff and wire OpenTelemetry exporters from Go services.
4. Draft compliance checklist for LLM usage, Go binary hardening, and embedded asset integrity; circulate to Legal and Security stakeholders by Week 2.
5. Assemble beta tenant advisory group and confirm participation before Sprint 3, including environment readiness for the self-contained Go deployment.
